#### Hey! 👋

I'm Dmitry, a data analyst, a self-taught developer and a graduate of a business school.

I used to work a lot with `SQL`, `BigQuery`, `Tableau`, `Google Analytics`, `HTML/CSS`, `JavaScript` and many A/B testing tools. Now I'm focusing more on learning and working with `Python` and `Django`, mostly by developing web applications.

I'm based in Berlin, but I'm willing to relocate, and I'm currently looking for a new job or different projects.
