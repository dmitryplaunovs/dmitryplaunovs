#### Hey! 👋

I'm Dmitry, a data analyst, a self-taught developer and a graduate of a business school.

During the day I'm pulling data with `SQL`, running experiments in `A/B testing tools`, forecasting with `Python`, building data models in `dbt` and tracking users with `Segment`, `GTM` and `web tracking tools`.

During the night I'm developing apps in `django`, making them look nice with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`, tracking with `Umami` or `Matomo` and self-hosting everything on a `VPS`.
